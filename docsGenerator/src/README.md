Take all the files from a directory and generate a static website from it.

Structure:
- index.html -> home page of the docs site
-

Page metadata:
- title: string -> title to display in the browser title
- TOC: generate a TOC based on the markdown headers
- TOC behavior can be configured from the page metadata

The docs site should support versionning
- display in the page a way to jump to an older version of the docs site
